The goal of ggplot-transparency-test is to demonstrate an issue I am having where I want my ggplot images to have a transparent background, so that when they are on a slide with a background colour, they are the same colour.

See the github page for a demo: https://njtierney.github.io/ggplot-transparency-test/#/title-slide
